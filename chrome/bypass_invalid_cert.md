# How to bypass the invalid cert issue

A quick way to bypass this message:  open Advanced and see if you have a "proceed to website" option. If not, you can try typing "thisisunsafe" or "badidea" directly in chrome on the same page. Don't do this unless the site is one you trust or develop. The text "thisisunsafe" and "badidea" says a lot!
